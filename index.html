		<h2>Welcome to my home page!</h2>
			
		<p>
			I am a graduate from Centennial College with an Advanced Diploma in Software Engineering Technology and 
			from the University of Toronto with an Honours Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Media Studies and minoring in 
			English and Psychology.
		</p>

		<p>
			The purpose of the GitHub Pages implementation of trentb10/studentweb-cencol is to host all of the 
			assignments I've completed for COMP213 Web Interface Design and COMP125 Client-Side Development at 
			Centennial College, which can all be accessed below. This allows me to keep them in HTML files as they were 
			originally made in while I migrate my main studentweb-cencol website to a new frontend framework. 
		</p>

		<p>
			When that website is ready, the link will be here!

		<p>
			Please note: These assignments were tested for and works on Mozilla Firefox. They are viewable in other 
			web browsers, however, they may not work as intended. This is the case for COMP125 Assignment 3, where a 
			JavaScript function works fine in FF, but not in Google Chrome.
